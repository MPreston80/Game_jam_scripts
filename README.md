# Game_jam_scripts
Scripts for a Unity game I created 
For a game development class I was required to create a game given a particular theme. This was called a game jam, and the theme of the game I created for this game jam was bubble gum.
All assets in the game except music were created by me, and the game can be played at: https://play.unity.com/mg/other/marvin-the-moose-s-bubble-gum-adventure
