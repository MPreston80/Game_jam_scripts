# Game_jam_scripts
I took a game development class, and I participated in two game jams that were required for the course. The scripts for the game I created during the second game jam, which had a theme of bubble gum, are in this repository. The game can be played at: https://play.unity.com/mg/other/marvin-the-moose-s-bubble-gum-adventure
